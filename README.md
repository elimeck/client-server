client-server
=============

The client server was created using Gearman.

Features include:

  a.  Payments Processing
  b.  Reports Analysis
  
The client server talks to a Core Server.
Client Servers process user request asynchronously and the core server responds seamlessly in realtime.

Once connected to the core server, it can process particular request from the user.
Client Server will last a maximum of 60 days once the core server does not have any requests to work with.

To setup, simply download a fresh copy and change the keys in config.php file.

If you prefer not to hack around, sign up and download a copy from your dashboard.

Happy hacking.

Note that this project is in constant development and will fully start operating from 01-01-2015.
